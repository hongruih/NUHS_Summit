# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the App

**Production (Gunicorn):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:5001
# Open http://localhost:5001
```

**Local dev (Flask built-in server):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5001
```

Install dependencies (first time or after reset):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local dev):
- `PORT` — port the app listens on (default: `5001`; set automatically by Render/Railway); pass to Gunicorn via `--bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- `DATABASE_PATH` — path to the SQLite file (default: `booth_data.db`; set to e.g. `/data/booth_data.db` on Render with a persistent disk)
- `FLASK_DEBUG` — set to `true` for local development only (has no effect under Gunicorn)

There is no build step, test suite, or linter configured.

## Architecture

`app.py` (~887 lines) contains all routes and business logic. HTML lives in `templates/`.

**Data persistence**: SQLite via `booth_data.db` (path overridable via `DATABASE_PATH` env var; auto-created on startup by `init_db()`). WAL mode enabled (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`) for concurrent read performance under Gunicorn.

**Key in-file sections** (separated by banner comments):
- Lines ~47–128: Configuration — `QUESTIONS` (4 open-ended questions), `STOP_WORDS`, `SCENARIOS` (5 Turing test clinical cases), `JOB_GROUPS`, `SENIORITY_LEVELS`, `TRUST_TASKS`, `ACCEPTANCE_PART_A`, `ACCEPTANCE_LIKERT` (41 Likert questions across Parts B–F)
- Lines ~134–299: Database setup (`get_db`, `init_db`) — creates 5 tables: `sentiment_responses`, `turing_responses`, `turing_answers`, `turing_tasks`, `acceptance_responses`; also runs a safe `ALTER TABLE` migration to add `participant_id` to `sentiment_responses`
- Lines ~301–457: Business logic — `sentiment()` (TextBlob polarity/subjectivity), `extract_words()` (word frequency, top 80 words, stop-word filtered), `get_turing_stats()` (full analytics with optional job-group filter)
- Lines ~460–887: Flask routes — participant pages, admin, all API endpoints, Excel export

**Templates** (`templates/`):
- `landing.html` — participant landing page; 3 survey cards in order: AI vs Human → AI Perspectives → AI Acceptance Survey; clicking "AI Perspectives" opens an instruction modal before navigating; mobile-scroll-safe (no `overflow:hidden` on body, `justify-content:flex-start` on small screens with safe-area bottom padding)
- `admin.html` — main 6-tab admin dashboard (rendered at `/admin`)
- `survey_turing.html` — mobile Turing test survey (rendered at `/survey/turing`)
- `survey_sentiment.html` — sentiment survey with microphone + text input (rendered at `/survey/sentiment`)
- `survey_acceptance.html` — AI acceptance survey (rendered at `/survey/acceptance`); first screen is a consent/intro step (anonymous notice + ARCHIVE research consent); clicking "Begin Survey" proceeds to the 13-step question flow (8 Part A biographical + 5 Likert parts B–F)

**Design system**: All templates use a Google-inspired light theme — white (`#ffffff`) / light grey (`#f1f3f4`) backgrounds, `#202124` primary text, `#5f6368` secondary text, `#dadce0` borders. Accent colours (indigo `#4f46e5`/`#6366f1`, pink `#ec4899`, purple `#a855f7`, cyan `#06b6d4`) are used for buttons, highlights, and gradients. Do not introduce dark backgrounds or light-on-dark text.

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Participant landing page — 3 survey cards |
| `GET /admin` | Main 6-tab dashboard (staff-facing) |
| `GET /survey` | Redirects to `/survey/turing` |
| `GET /survey/turing` | Mobile-friendly Turing test survey (attendee-facing, QR-accessible) |
| `GET /survey/sentiment` | Sentiment survey |
| `GET /survey/acceptance` | AI Acceptance Survey |
| `GET /qr` | Generates PNG QR code pointing to `/survey/turing` |
| `POST /api/submit` | Submit a sentiment response (JSON: `text`, `question_index`) |
| `GET /api/q/<int:q>` | Word cloud + stats for question index 0–2 |
| `GET /api/all` | Aggregate data for all questions + Turing snapshot |
| `POST /api/turing/submit` | Submit a completed Turing test survey |
| `GET /api/turing/stats` | Full Turing test analytics |
| `GET /api/turing/scenarios` | Scenarios without AI labels (used by survey form) |
| `POST /api/acceptance/submit` | Submit AI Acceptance Survey (JSON: Part A fields + `likert_answers`) |
| `GET /api/acceptance/stats` | AI Acceptance Survey analytics (Part A distributions + Likert averages) |
| `POST /api/reset` | Wipe all data from all tables (incl. acceptance_responses) |
| `GET /api/export` | Export all data as JSON (incl. acceptance stats) |

## Admin Dashboard Tabs (current)

1. **Live Overview** — aggregate word cloud + sentiment + Turing snapshot
2–4. **Q1/Q2/Q3 Input** — record/type responses per question, per-question dashboard
5. **Per-Q Dashboard** — all 3 questions' word clouds and sentiments side-by-side
6. **AI vs Human** — Turing test survey UI + live results dashboard

## Data Model Notes

- `sentiment_responses`: stores free-text audience responses with pre-computed TextBlob polarity/subjectivity/label
- `turing_responses`: one row per survey respondent (UUID, job group, seniority)
- `turing_answers`: one row per scenario per respondent (guess, correctness, 4 ratings 1–5)
- `turing_tasks`: which AI tasks each respondent trusts (multi-select)
- `acceptance_responses`: one row per respondent — Part A fields as individual columns; `disciplines` and `ai_tools` stored as JSON arrays; `likert_answers` stored as JSON object `{"B1": 3, ..., "F7": 5}` covering all 41 questions across Parts B–F
- The `ai_index` field in `SCENARIOS` (0 or 1) indicates which response is AI-generated; this is never exposed to the survey frontend
