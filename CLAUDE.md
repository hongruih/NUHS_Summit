# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Running the App

**Production (Gunicorn):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:5001
# Open http://localhost:5001
```

**Local dev (Flask built-in server):**
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5001
```

Install dependencies (first time or after reset):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **TextBlob corpora** — on first run TextBlob may need its punkt tokeniser. If you see a corpus error, run:
> ```bash
> python -m textblob.download_corpora
> ```

> **spaCy model** — `pip install -r requirements.txt` installs the spaCy library but **not** the language model, which must be downloaded separately:
> ```bash
> python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
> ```
> The app runs without it (graceful fallback to the original Counter-based word counting), but spaCy is required for lemmatised, POS-filtered word clouds.

Environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local dev):
- `PORT` — port the app listens on (default: `5001`; set automatically by Render/Railway); pass to Gunicorn via `--bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- `DATABASE_PATH` — path to the SQLite file (default: `booth_data.db`; set to e.g. `/data/booth_data.db` on Render with a persistent disk)
- `FLASK_DEBUG` — set to `true` for local development only (has no effect under Gunicorn)

There is no build step, test suite, or linter configured.

## Architecture

`app.py` (~887 lines) contains all routes and business logic. HTML lives in `templates/`.

**Data persistence**: SQLite via `booth_data.db` (path overridable via `DATABASE_PATH` env var; auto-created on startup by `init_db()`). WAL mode enabled (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`) for concurrent read performance under Gunicorn.

**Key in-file sections** (separated by banner comments):
- Lines ~47–128: Configuration — `QUESTIONS` (4 open-ended questions), `STOP_WORDS`, `SCENARIOS` (5 Turing test clinical cases), `JOB_GROUPS`, `SENIORITY_LEVELS`, `TRUST_TASKS`, `ACCEPTANCE_PART_A`, `ACCEPTANCE_LIKERT` (41 Likert questions across Parts B–F)
- Lines ~134–299: Database setup (`get_db`, `init_db`) — creates 5 tables: `sentiment_responses`, `turing_responses`, `turing_answers`, `turing_tasks`, `acceptance_responses`; also runs a safe `ALTER TABLE` migration to add `participant_id` to `sentiment_responses`
- Lines ~301–457: Business logic — `sentiment()` (TextBlob polarity/subjectivity), `extract_words()` (spaCy lemmatisation + NOUN/VERB/ADJ POS filter + merged stop words + profanity filter → top 80 words; falls back to regex Counter if spaCy unavailable), `get_turing_stats()` (full analytics with optional job-group filter)
- Lines ~460–887: Flask routes — participant pages, admin, all API endpoints, Excel export

**Templates** (`templates/`):
- `landing.html` — participant landing page; 3 survey cards in order: AI vs Human → AI Perspectives → AI Acceptance Survey; clicking "AI Perspectives" opens an instruction modal before navigating; mobile-scroll-safe (no `overflow:hidden` on body, `justify-content:flex-start` on small screens with safe-area bottom padding)
- `admin.html` — 7-tab admin dashboard (rendered at `/admin`); status bar at top shows Total / AI vs Human / AI Perspectives / AI Acceptance counts; tabs split into left group (Live Overview, Q1–Q3 Input) and right group (AI vs Human, AI Perspectives, AI Acceptance) separated by `margin-left:auto` on the `.tab.tt` class
- `survey_turing.html` — mobile Turing test survey (rendered at `/survey/turing`); "Other" job group selection reveals an inline free-text input; combined value saved as `"Other; <custom text>"`
- `survey_sentiment.html` — sentiment survey with microphone + text input (rendered at `/survey/sentiment`); polarity score is calculated and stored but **not displayed** to participants — only the sentiment label (Positive/Neutral/Negative) and polarity bar are shown
- `survey_acceptance.html` — AI acceptance survey (rendered at `/survey/acceptance`); first screen is a consent/intro step (anonymous notice + HCRD research consent); clicking "Begin Survey" proceeds to the 13-step question flow (8 Part A biographical + 5 Likert parts B–F); completion screen shows a gift booth message ("show this page at the Healthcare Redesign booth") with confetti animation

**Design system**: All templates use a Google-inspired light theme — white (`#ffffff`) / light grey (`#f1f3f4`) backgrounds, `#202124` primary text, `#5f6368` secondary text, `#dadce0` borders. Accent colours (indigo `#4f46e5`/`#6366f1`, pink `#ec4899`, purple `#a855f7`, cyan `#06b6d4`) are used for buttons, highlights, and gradients. Do not introduce dark backgrounds or light-on-dark text.

## Admin Dashboard Tabs (current)

The admin nav bar has **7 tabs** split into two visual groups (separated by `margin-left:auto` on `.tab.tt`):

**Left group:**
1. **Live Overview** (📊) — aggregate word cloud + sentiment + Turing snapshot; auto-refreshes every 3 s
2. **Q1 Input** — record/type Q1 responses; per-question word cloud and sentiment
3. **Q2 Input** — same for Q2
4. **Q3 Input** — same for Q3

**Right group (right-aligned):**
5. **AI vs Human** (🤖, pink) — Turing test live results: accuracy by job group/seniority/scenario, ratings, task trust chart; filterable by job group
6. **AI Perspectives** (💬, cyan) — all 3 questions' word clouds and sentiments side-by-side
7. **AI Acceptance** (📋, purple) — Part A demographic distributions + Parts B–F Likert averages

**Status bar** (top-right of header): four pills in order — Total responses | AI vs Human count | AI Perspectives count | AI Acceptance count. Counts sourced from: AI vs Human = `turing_responses` row count; AI Perspectives = `sentiment_responses` rows for `question_index=0` (i.e. unique participants who answered at least Q1); AI Acceptance = `/api/acceptance/stats` `total_respondents`. Total = sum of all three.

## Data Model Notes

- `sentiment_responses`: stores free-text audience responses with pre-computed TextBlob polarity/subjectivity/label; `participant_id` column added via safe `ALTER TABLE` migration
- `turing_responses`: one row per survey respondent (UUID, job group, seniority); `job_group` may be `"Other; <custom text>"` when participant selected "Other" and typed a description
- `turing_answers`: one row per scenario per respondent (guess, correctness, 4 ratings 1–5)
- `turing_tasks`: which AI tasks each respondent trusts (multi-select; one row per task)
- `acceptance_responses`: one row per respondent — Part A fields as individual columns; `disciplines` and `ai_tools` stored as JSON arrays; `likert_answers` stored as JSON object `{"B1": 3, ..., "F7": 5}` covering all 41 questions across Parts B–F
- The `ai_index` field in `SCENARIOS` (0 or 1) indicates which response is AI-generated; this is **never** exposed to the survey frontend
